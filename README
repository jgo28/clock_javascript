This is a web application that has three main features: a clock, a timer, and a stopwatch. The user can swap between
these three modes by clicking the buttons at the top of the application. 

There is an options button on the left that will allow the user to customize the application and change settings
for the clock feature.

To launch the app, make sure all the files are in the same directory and double-click main.html
